        <h2>About</h2>
        <div class="smallunderline"></div>
        <p>These are the simfiles I've made, organised into packs. Under each pack's banner, you'll see the pack's title, the amount of songs included, the download link, followed by any extra information like the date it was last updated.</p>
        <p>Beneath that is a button that opens a drop-down list of the songs in the pack. The song name is in bold, followed by the artist, and after that are the difficulties from easiest to hardest (using stepmania's Simply Love skin colour scheme to make
            it easier to tell). If a difficulty is left blank, it simply means that song doesn't have a chart for that difficulty. Finally, the last number is the song's length.</p>
        <p>These packs were made primarily for me and my spouse, which means that they don't (yet) include the higher difficulties since we're both new to stepmania, and that they were designed with stepmania as a form of excercise in mind (as opposed to
            playing with a bar), so there might also be more jumps than you'd expect.</p>
        <p>I'm still learning, so it's likely I'll end up going back to a lot of the older packs to try and fix them up a bit, or maybe even add difficulties that I skipped. To make that easier to keep track of, you can simply check the "last updated" information
            under the download link.</p>
        <p>As for the difficulty ratings, I'm trying to base them of other packs I've played, but it's an incredibly subjective thing to rate, and I've seen huge disparancy already between packs. All I can really try to do is make my packs internally consistent
            with their difficulty ratings. However, if you feel that I've failed at even that, feel free to contact me about it and I'll see about getting it adjusted.</p>
